This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app takes in a specific Pokemon type in the search bar and displays a list of cards with Pokemon that have that specific type. If you click on the name cards you can see a more detailed card of that Pokemon in a dropdown.
